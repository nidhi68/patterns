Patterns are the very first thing that the beginners can start with in python by using simple for loops.First outer loop is used to handle number of rows and inner nested loop is used to handle number of columns and finally by changing print statements, different number patterns,alphabet patterns or star patterns can be printed out easily.
Some of the Patterns are listed in this repository named 'patterns'.
